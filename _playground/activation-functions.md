Apart from **ReLU** and **Softmax**, there are several other activation functions that can be used in neural networks depending on the specific layer and the nature of the problem. Here are some common alternatives:

### 1. **Sigmoid (Logistic Activation)**
   - **Equation**: \( \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \)
   - **Usage**: Often used for binary classification problems (output between 0 and 1).
   - **Pros**: Outputs in the range of (0, 1), which can be interpreted as a probability.
   - **Cons**: Vanishing gradient problem for large negative inputs, making it difficult to train deep networks.

### 2. **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**
   - **Equation**: \( \tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \)
   - **Range**: (-1, 1)
   - **Usage**: Usually used in hidden layers. It centers the data, which can make training easier.
   - **Pros**: Zero-centered outputs can lead to faster convergence compared to sigmoid.
   - **Cons**: Similar to Sigmoid, it also suffers from the vanishing gradient problem for large inputs.

### 3. **Leaky ReLU**
   - **Equation**: \( f(x) = \max(0.01x, x) \)
   - **Usage**: Similar to ReLU but allows a small, non-zero gradient when the unit is inactive, which helps alleviate the dying ReLU problem.
   - **Pros**: Prevents neurons from "dying" during training by allowing a small gradient for negative inputs.
   - **Cons**: It still does not eliminate the possibility of vanishing gradients entirely.

### 4. **PReLU (Parametric ReLU)**
   - **Equation**: \( f(x) = \max(\alpha x, x) \)
   - **Usage**: A variant of Leaky ReLU where the slope of the negative part (\( \alpha \)) is learned during training.
   - **Pros**: It provides flexibility by allowing the model to learn the parameter \(\alpha\) that adjusts the slope.
   - **Cons**: It adds additional parameters to train, which might increase computation.

### 5. **ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)**
   - **Equation**: \( f(x) = x \) if \( x > 0 \), else \( \alpha(e^x - 1) \) where \(\alpha > 0\)
   - **Usage**: Commonly used in hidden layers of deep networks to improve convergence.
   - **Pros**: It has a small negative output for negative inputs, which pushes the mean closer to zero, reducing bias shifts.
   - **Cons**: Computationally more expensive compared to ReLU because of the exponential calculation.

### 6. **Swish**
   - **Equation**: \( f(x) = x \cdot \sigma(x) \)
   - **Usage**: Often used in deeper architectures, such as Google's EfficientNet.
   - **Pros**: Has shown improvements in deeper networks. It smoothens the gradient, potentially improving training.
   - **Cons**: Computationally more intensive compared to ReLU.

### 7. **GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)**
   - **Equation**: \( f(x) = 0.5x(1 + \tanh[\sqrt{2/\pi}(x + 0.044715x^3)]) \)
   - **Usage**: Recently popular in Transformer models, such as BERT.
   - **Pros**: Provides smoother output compared to ReLU and helps improve convergence in deep networks.
   - **Cons**: More computationally expensive due to the complex formula.

### 8. **Linear Activation (Identity Function)**
   - **Equation**: \( f(x) = x \)
   - **Usage**: Commonly used in output layers for regression problems.
   - **Pros**: No modification to the input, which allows unrestricted output range, useful for regression tasks.
   - **Cons**: Doesn't introduce any non-linearity, which may limit the power of neural networks if used in hidden layers.

### 9. **Softplus**
   - **Equation**: \( f(x) = \log(1 + e^x) \)
   - **Usage**: Used in hidden layers, similar to ReLU.
   - **Pros**: Differentiable everywhere, and the output is always positive.
   - **Cons**: It can have a similar vanishing gradient problem for large negative inputs.

### 10. **Softsign**
   - **Equation**: \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + |x|} \)
   - **Usage**: Used in place of sigmoid or tanh, generally in hidden layers.
   - **Pros**: Zero-centered and provides a smooth gradient.
   - **Cons**: Slower convergence compared to other activation functions.

### Summary:
- **ReLU Variants** like **Leaky ReLU**, **PReLU**, and **ELU** are often used in hidden layers to address the vanishing gradient problem and improve model training.
- **Tanh** and **Sigmoid** are commonly used for specific purposes, but they may suffer from vanishing gradients for deep networks.
- **Softmax** is widely used in the output layer for **multi-class classification**, whereas **Linear** is used in **regression** problems.
- **GELU**, **Swish**, and **Softplus** provide more sophisticated alternatives and can offer performance improvements in deeper architectures.

The choice of activation function depends on the problem, the network architecture, and the desired output. Each activation has its strengths and weaknesses, and often, experimenting with multiple activation functions is necessary to determine the best one for your model.
