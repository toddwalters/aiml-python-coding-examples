    "## __Step 5 Code Breakdown__\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code snippet defines a `train` function that trains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, which are trained together in an adversarial manner. The goal of the generator is to produce realistic fake images, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and fake images. Let's break down the code step by step to understand its components and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Function Definition__\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def train(epochs=1, batch_size=128):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `train` function is defined to train the GAN for a specified number of epochs and batch size. The default values are set to 1 epoch and a batch size of 128.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Loading and Preprocessing the Data__\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load the data\n",
    "(X_train, _), (_, _) = mnist.load_data()\n",
    "X_train = (X_train.astype(np.float32) - 127.5) / 127.5\n",
    "X_train = np.expand_dims(X_train, axis=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Data:** The MNIST dataset is loaded using the `mnist.load_data()` function. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, but only the training images (`X_train`) are used in this function. The labels are ignored using the underscore `_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalizing the Data:** The pixel values of the training images are normalized to the range [-1, 1] by subtracting 127.5 and dividing by 127.5. This normalization helps improve the performance and convergence of the GAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expanding Dimensions:** The training images are reshaped to add an extra dimension, making them suitable for the input shape expected by the discriminator. The new shape is (28, 28, 1), where the last dimension represents the single color channel (grayscale).\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Defining Labels for Training__\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Labels for the batch size and the test size\n",
    "y_train_ones = np.ones((batch_size, 1))\n",
    "y_train_zeros = np.zeros((batch_size, 1))\n",
    "y_test_ones = np.ones((100, 1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real Labels:** `y_train_ones` is a batch of labels with the value 1, representing real images. These labels are used when training the discriminator with real images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fake Labels:** `y_train_zeros` is a batch of labels with the value 0, representing fake images. These labels are used when training the discriminator with fake images generated by the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Labels:** `y_test_ones` is a batch of labels with the value 1, used for testing the generator. This is not used in the provided code snippet but can be useful for evaluating the generator's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Training Loop__\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Start training\n",
    "for e in range(epochs):\n",
    "    for i in range(X_train.shape[0] // batch_size):\n",
    "        # Train Discriminator weights\n",
    "        discriminator.trainable = True\n",
    "        # Real samples\n",
    "        X_batch = X_train[i*batch_size:(i+1)*batch_size]\n",
    "        d_loss_real = discriminator.train_on_batch(x=X_batch, y=y_train_ones * (1 - 0.1 * np.random.rand(batch_size, 1)))\n",
    "        # Fake Samples\n",
    "        z_noise = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=(batch_size, 100))\n",
    "        X_fake = generator.predict_on_batch(z_noise)\n",
    "        d_loss_fake = discriminator.train_on_batch(x=X_fake, y=y_train_zeros)\n",
    "        # Discriminator loss\n",
    "        d_loss = 0.5 * (d_loss_real + d_loss_fake)\n",
    "        # Train Generator weights\n",
    "        discriminator.trainable = False\n",
    "        g_loss = gan.train_on_batch(x=z_noise, y=y_train_ones)\n",
    "        print(f'Epoch: {e+1}, Batch: {i}, D Loss: {d_loss}, G Loss: {g_loss}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Epoch Loop:** The outer loop iterates over the specified number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch Loop:** The inner loop iterates over the training data in batches. The batch size is specified by the `batch_size` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training the Discriminator:**\n",
    "   - **Real Samples:** A batch of real images is selected from the training data. The discriminator is trained on these real images with labels `y_train_ones`, slightly perturbed by random noise to improve training stability.\n",
    "   - **Fake Samples:** A batch of random noise vectors is generated and passed through the generator to produce fake images. The discriminator is trained on these fake images with labels `y_train_zeros`.\n",
    "   - **Discriminator Loss:** The loss for the discriminator is calculated as the average of the losses on real and fake images.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training the Generator:**\n",
    "   - **Freezing the Discriminator:** The discriminator's weights are frozen to ensure that only the generator's weights are updated during this step.\n",
    "   - **Generator Training:** The generator is trained to produce images that the discriminator classifies as real. This is done by training the GAN model with the random noise vectors and labels `y_train_ones`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Logging the Losses:** The losses for the discriminator and generator are printed for each batch, providing insight into the training progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Summary__\n",
    "\n",
    "The `train` function trains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the MNIST dataset. The function loads and preprocesses the data, defines labels for real and fake images, and iterates over the specified number of epochs and batches. During each iteration, the discriminator is trained on real and fake images, and the generator is trained to produce images that the discriminator classifies as real. The losses for the discriminator and generator are logged for each batch, providing insight into the training progress. This training process allows the GAN to learn to generate realistic images that resemble the real images from the training dataset.\n"
