    "In today’s modern world, huge shopping centers such as big malls and marts are recording data related to sales of items or products as an important step to predict the sales and get an idea about future demands that can help with inventory management. Understanding what role certain properties of an item play and how they affect their sales is imperative to any retail business\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. Using this data, **BigMart is trying to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales**.\n",

    "**Data Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have two datasets - train (8523) and test (5681) data. The training dataset has both input and output variable(s). You will need to predict the sales for the test dataset.\n",
    "* The data may have missing values as some stores might not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly.\n",
    "* As the variables Item_Identifier and Outlet_Identifier are ID variables, we assume that they don't have any predictive power to predict the dependent variable - Item_Outlet_Sales. We will remove these two variables from both datasets.\n",
    "* The training dataset has 8523 observations and 10 columns.\n",
    "* Two columns Item_Weight and Outlet_Size have missing values as the number of non-null values is less than the total number of observations for these two variables.\n",
    "* We observe that the columns Item_Fat_Content, Item_Type, Outlet_Size, Outlet_Location_Type, and Outlet_Type have data type objects, which means they are strings or categorical variables.\n",
    "* The remaining variables are all numerical in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations from EDA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the Univariate plot for the variable Item_Fat_Content, it seems like there are errors in the data. The category - Low Fat is also written as low fat and LF. Similarly, the category Regular is also written as reg sometimes. So, we need to fix this issue in the data.\n",
    "* For the column Outlet_Size, we can see that the most common category is - Medium followed by Small and High.\n",
    "* The most common category for the column Outlet_Location_Type is Tier 3, followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1. This makes sense now if we combine this information with the information on column Outlet_Size. We would expect High outlet size stores to be present in Tier 1 cities and the count of tier 1 cities is less so the count of high outlets size is also less. And we would expect more medium and small outlet sizes in the dataset because we have more number outlets present in tier 3 and tier 2 cities in the dataset.\n",
    "* In the column Outlet_Type, the majority of the stores are of Supermarket Type 1 and we have a less and almost equal number of representatives in the other categories - Supermarket Type 2, Supermarket Type 3, and Grocery Store.\n",
    "* We observed that majority of the items sold in these stores are Fruits and Vegetables, followed by Snack Foods and Household items.\n",
    "* The variable Item_Weight is approx uniformly distributed and when we will impute the missing values for this column, we will need to keep in mind that we don't end up changing the distribution significantly after imputing those missing values.\n",
    "* The variable Item_Visibility is a right-skewed distribution which means that there are certain items whose percentage of the display area is much higher than the other items.\n",
    "* The variable Item_MRP is following an approx multi-modal normal distribution.\n",
    "* The average sales are almost constant every year, we don't see any increasing/decreasing trend in sales with time. So, the variable year might not be a good predictor to predict sales, which we can check later in the modeling phase.\n",
    "* Also, in the year 1998, the average sales plummeted. This might be due to some external factors which are not included in the data.\n",
    "* It seems that only the independent variable Item_MRP has a moderate linear relationship with the dependent variable Item_Outlet_Sales.\n",
