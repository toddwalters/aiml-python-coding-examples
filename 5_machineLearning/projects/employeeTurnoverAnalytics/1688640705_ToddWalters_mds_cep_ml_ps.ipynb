Their departure might be a significant loss for the company, possibly driven by external opportunities rather than internal dissatisfaction. Retention efforts should be strong with this group, as they are likely top performers.\n",

    "â€¢\tFor example, in medical diagnostics or fraud detection, where failing to identify a positive case can have severe consequences.\n",

    "â€¢\tThe cost of a false positive is high.\n",

    "For predicting employee turnover, Recall is typically more important than Precision. Hereâ€™s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "â€¢\tRecall Focus:\n",
    "â€¢\tIn the context of employee turnover, it is crucial to identify all employees who are likely to leave. Missing an at-risk employee (False Negative) means missing the opportunity to intervene and potentially retain them.\n",
    "â€¢\tHigh Recall ensures that most of the at-risk employees are identified, even if it means having some false positives (employees predicted to leave who actually donâ€™t).\n",
    "â€¢\tPrecision Focus:\n",
    "â€¢\tWhile high Precision means fewer false positives, the main priority is to ensure that all possible cases of turnover are captured, even at the expense of having more false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the importance of identifying all employees at risk of leaving, Recall should be the primary metric to focus on in your models. Here are the Recall values from the confusion matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tLogistic Regression:\n",
    "\t\n",
    "    - Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 506 / (506 + 208) â‰ˆ 0.71\n",
    "  \n",
    "2.\tRandom Forest Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 666 / (666 + 48) â‰ˆ 0.93\n",
    "  \n",
    "3.\tGradient Boosting Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 659 / (659 + 55) â‰ˆ 0.92\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on Recall, **the Random Forest Classifier performs the best in terms of identifying employees who are likely to leave**, followed closely by the Gradient Boosting Classifier. Therefore, you should prioritize the model with the highest Recall for your employee turnover prediction task."
